**Status**: DONE ‚úÖ<br>
**Hours played**: 72<br>

### The Good üëç
- Great story with interesting characters and a lot of different fully voice acted dialogs.
- Good build variety with very cool and flashy spells.
- Beautiful maps with a lot of depth that makes you want to explore every little corner.
- Combat is fun and strategic and there's a lot of enemy variety.
- Good length, didn't drag on too much.
- Good/simple gear and leveling system.
- Great with friends, but good luck finishing a campaign ;)

### The Bad üëé
- Some encounters are very frustrating with unfun mechanics, but they are quite rare.
- The armor system discourages having physical and magical damage in the same party. Would've loved to run a warrior/mage duo but had to do warrior/ranger.
- Difficulty spike in act 4 is pretty nuts. I had to reduce the difficulty because I just wanted to progress the story and not redo the same fights over and over until I got good RNG.

# SCORE: 9/10
