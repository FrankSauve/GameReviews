### The Good 👍
- Perfection. Easily top 3 games I ever played.
- It's so addictive in the best way possible. I just couldn't put it down. 
- Every time you try a new boss you slowly learn the mechanics of it and the satisfaction of finally killing one is amazing.
- The enemy/boss variety is great, the different zones are so intriguing and make you want to explore every single corner.
- The progression system is great and also very punishing at the same time.
- Great replayability and build variety
