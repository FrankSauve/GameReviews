**Status**: DONE-ish ✅<br>
**Hours played**: 20<br>

### The Good 👍
- One of the best rogue-likes I've ever played.
- It set the bar very high for rogue-likes with great story and progression.
- S tier art and music
- Supergiant is a cool studio

### The Bad 👎
- Gameplay is nothing too crazy, feels like I'm mostly button mashing

# SCORE: 9/10
