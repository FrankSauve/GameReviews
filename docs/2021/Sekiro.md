### The Good üëç
- Interesting combat mechanics, its nice to see that they tried something different than DS. It felt very smooth and fast-paced.
- Good story and environment.
- Good level design and beautiful zones.
- Challenging boss fights with cool mechanics.
- Shinobis are cool.

### The Bad üëé
- Most zones are way too easy, only challenge comes from bosses and mini-bosses.
- Copy-paste bosses and mini-bosses. You have to fight the same version of some bosses 2-3 times.
- Very linear progression and no build variety at all. You're stuck with the same katana and armor the whole game. There's a big lack of depth compared to DS games.
- Unlocking prosthetics and skills felt pretty useless unless it was needed for a gimmick enemy.
- Dying didn't really have an impact. I basically ignored the Dragonrot mechanic the whole time.
- Combat can be quite boring even if its new. I think this is because there is no stamina bar. You can just spam parry and R1 on every enemy without any consequence.

Even if this sounds pretty negative, I actually enjoyed the game a lot. If you're a fan of FromSoftware games, you definitely need to give this one a try.
