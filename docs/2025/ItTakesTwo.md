### The Good üëç
- Amazing gameplay mechanics. Each section had super fun new mechanics and they all felt so smooth and fun to play with. I really liked the mage/fighter section where we beat up some enemies.
- Level design is incredible. The levels were all so unique and fun to traverse. There was so much creativity and love poured into every corner of each level. They all felt like a completely new experience and I never got bored in this game.
- Character movement and traversal was excellent. The jumps, dashes and general movement felt so smooth while still feeling accurate.
- Environements are really beautiful and the art in general was really great.
- Puzzle and boss mechanics never felt repetitive or like a chore. They were all so well designed.
- The narative is fun and whimsical. It had strong "we're all kids at heart" energy.
- Very cool that only one person has to buy the game to play online coop. Joining each other's games was also very easy.
- Voice acting was very good and all the different characters were fun. Especially Dr. Hakim, I thought he nailed it.
- Mini games were tons of fun to compete in. My personal favorite was the swing one.

### The Bad üëé
- Story is very predictable. Which it kinda had to be since its like a pixar story, but a little more twists and turns could've been fun.
