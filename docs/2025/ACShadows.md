**Hours played**: 15<br>

### The Good üëç
- Environments are really beautiful and you can tell there was a lot of effort put into them.
- The weather and season system is awesome. The way the leaves and trees move in the wind was really cool to watch.
- Parkour (with Naoe) is still one of the best parts of AC games. It's really smooth and satisfying to jump from building to building with sick ninja moves. The addition of Naoe's grappling hook is also very fun. Animation team did a killer job here.
- The core assassin gameloop is still fun to me. Sneaking into a town, avoiding the guards and assassinating the big bad guy is cool to me.
- I loved that they added the option to insta-assassinate enemies no matter their level and HP bars. I really hated that in old AC RPGs it kinda removed the whole stealth option so I'm glad they found a way to solve this.
- Combat is simple, but gets the job done. Also, I find the combat animations a lot smoother than older ACs. There's less stuttering and interrupting.
- The base building mechanics were nice and well done even though I didn't play with them much since it's not my thing.

### The Bad üëé
- The story is very mid and predictable. There are too many characters to keep track of and you just end up not caring about any of them. They also, once again, did the Ubisoft classic of being able to do certain main quests in whatever order so the story never feels like one big linear story with interesting plot points and instead feels like a mish mash of story beats.
- Locking the perk tiers behind knowledge points which are unlocked by doing copy-paste open world side quest is cringe.
- Having minimum level requirements on the main quests that force you to do side quest at some points. Please just let me do the main quest if that's all I want to do.
- Voice acting and facial animation are both a little rough and robotic.
- Yasuke gameplay is SO boring outside of combat. He's super slow, can't jump or parkour anything. I avoided playing him for most of the game.
- I guess it's kinda Feudal Japan's fault, but every town and castle looked the exact same and it's hard to tell them a part. I get that it's realistic, but for a video game it felt kinda lack-luster to discover new towns.
- Music is really weird. Sometimes it'll just start playing a modern hip-hop beat or 80s synth pop beat in the middle of the fight and it just doesn't fit.

After 15 hours, I was at about the halfway point of the main story and I felt like I had seen everything the game had to offer. The story was dragging and the gameplay loop was getting reptitive so I called it quits there. Still had fun time with the game but I just want to play other stuff y'know.
