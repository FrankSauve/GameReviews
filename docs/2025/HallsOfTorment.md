### The Good 👍
- Love the 90s RPG art style.
- Good variety of playable characters.
- Very addicting gameplay at first.
- Tons of achievements to try to unlock with each run.
- Some nice rogue-like mechanics that make you stronger the more runs you do.
- I liked the equipment mechanic where you send back one item to your base each run.
- Levels are fun and the enemies can be a little more challenging to kill than the waves of enemies in vamp survivors.

### The Bad 👎
- Gets repetitive and the game kinda only gets interesting in the chaos mode.
- The ability combos don't get as visually crazy as the ones in vamp survivors and you never really get the power fantasy of being super OP.
- Not enough variety in abilities and builds.

It's worth checking out for the price if you're craving a new survivor-like experience, but I didn't find it as interesting as Vampire Survivors.
