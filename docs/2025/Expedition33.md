### The Good 👍
- Such an amazing game that feels fresh, original and so well-crafted.
- The music is an absolute masterpiece. Banger after banger. I would often wait before playing my turn so I could jam out a little longer.
- The gameplay is one of my favorite things in this game. The mix of turn-based combat with dodging and parrying mechanics was really fun.
- The difficulty level throughout the game was perfect. A good amount of challenge, but it never felt too frustrating or unfair.
- There's a lot of different build possibilities and its very fun to craft your own builds.
- The progression is really good. The pacing of unlocking stronger and stronger abilities felt just right and at the end you just feel unstoppable.
- There are so many different enemies with different moves and abilities. The variety was amazing.
- Boss fights were a spectacle and so well made.
- Animation absolutely cooked on this game. Every attack and parry is soooo satisfying and meaty.
- I love the art style of the game. Environments and characters were gorgeous.
- The story is excellent. The characters were so captivating and I loved the journey they took us on. I love the ending.
- Voice acting is top-notch. They all did an amazing job to bring a lot of emotion to the characters.
- The extra side content to do either during the game or after is all really fun. There's some great bosses to beat and zones to explore that aren't part of the main story.

### The Bad 👎
- One small gripe is that act 3 felt too easy since I was a bit over-leveled without even trying to be. I only did the companion quests as "extra" content before doing act 3 and still I one shot everything there. It would be nice if that area was balanced to be a little harder.
