**Status**: DONE COOP ✅<br>
**Hours played**: 14<br>

### The Good 👍
- It's overall a pretty decent and it's especially fun to play it coop.
- The progression system and the cosmetic system were both well made and fun to interact with and unlock new things.
- The characters and villains in the game were fun. 
- Some missions and environments were very well designed and had some nice art.
- The traversal mechanics were very cool.
- Combat was decent and there were some fun abilities to use, but a little repetitive.
### The Bad 👎
- So much open world slop. Thankfully my coop partner did most of the required slop on his own so that we could progress the story when we we're playing together.
- The character and facial art and animations were pretty rough looking.
- The story is extremely forgettable and generic. I honestly lost all interest in the main story halfway through. 
- Around half the enemies are extremely annoying to fight. For example enemies that dodge everything you do until you do X type of attack. Just not that fun and interactive.
- Enemies become bullet sponges by the end of the game. They would require like 15-20 hits. We just lowered the difficulty at the end because it was just getting tedious.
- Some voice acting was awful. I'm not gonna name anyone, but batgirl was horrendously bad.
