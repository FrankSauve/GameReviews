**Status**: DNF ‚ùå<br>
**Hours played**: 4<br>

### The Good üëç
- Combat is pretty good and smooth especially against the metal creatures.
- World is really pretty.
- Story seems interesting.

### The Bad üëé
- I was actually really excited to play this one but its just the definition of a mid game. Nothing is great, nothing is horribly bad. Made it 4 hours into the game before calling it quits. Nothing hooked me.
- Didn't expect it to be a boring open world Ubisoft formula. Fetch quests, follow quests, escort quests, kill all monsters here quests, side quests that are the same. I know that formula was popular when this came out in 2017, but im so over it. I think the formula can be fun when travelling is fun (ex. spiderman swinging or GTA driving), but its kinda whatever in this game.
- I personally just hate the gathering, crafting, oops inventory is full gotta dump some stuff loop.
- Combat vs humans was way less fun than vs creatures.
- Its not my fav setting.
- The crappy robotic procedural mouth animations where the rest of the face doesnt react at all is so shit. I would just close my eyes, listen and imagine what the characters looked like when they spoke because that was more interesting.
- The voice acting is SO monotone. Shit puts me right to sleep. Especially Alloy, girl show some emotion.
- Lots of popping in dialogue, but once again eyes closed fixed that problem.
- Hand-holding voice lines that treat me like I'm fucking braindead every 5 seconds. Like "Shoot them in the eye! It's their weakspot!", "I need to scan the enemy!". They just take me out of the game and make me feel like the character is talking to me the player instead of the actual world. Let me play the game and discover new mechanics or which way to go on my own. All sense of discovery is just thrown out the window.
