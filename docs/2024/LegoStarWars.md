**Hours played**: 17<br>
**Status**: DONE ‚úÖ<br>

### The Good üëç
- Fun way to relive the movies. They tell the stories in a nice way and with appropriate length.
- The added jokes were funny. Good meme awareness.
- Gameplay is fun, smooth and simple.
- Platforming and puzzles were nice.
- Maps and levels were nicely design and fun to explore.
- Good casual game.

### The Bad üëé
- Being forced to hear Rey say "I need someone to show me my place in all this" everytime I open and close the game is ridiculous.
- I know its a kid's game, but lightsaber boss fights got repetitive.
- Voice acting could be hit or miss.

# SCORE: 8/10
