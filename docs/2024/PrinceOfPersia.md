**Hours played**: 15<br>
**Status**: DONE ‚úÖ<br>

### The Good üëç
- Great controls and gameplay feel. Combat and platforming both feel so snappy and responsive.
- Very fun platforming. It was probably my favorite part of the game. I love that it really makes use of your newly learned abilities all the time.
- Boss fights were all very unique and fun. 
- Great combat mechanics. I liked the parry a lot.
- Cool art style and vfx.
- A good kind of challenging while remaining fair.
- I liked that there was a guided mode because I don't like having to remember the locked doors in a metroidvania. I'd rather they show me where it was once I've unlocked the new ability.

### The Bad üëé
- Story was just ok. Wasn't really invested into it since most its exposure is at the beginning then "big" climax at the end. I wasn't really attached to the characters.
- Regular enemies kinda felt insignificant. I kinda just ignored them most of the time because they didn't give that many souls for the effort it took to kill them. 
- Too many back to back bosses at the end. It was getting tedious.
