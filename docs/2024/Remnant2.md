**Status**: DONE (Coop) ‚úÖ<br>
**Hours played**: 21<br>

### The Good üëç
- The gunplay is really smooth and fun. Guns feel satisfying to shoot and have a good punch to them.
- The world is really pretty. There's a lot of really beautiful environments.
- Areas and dungeons were fun to explore.
- Some bosses were very fun and well designed. Enemy variety was good as well.
- Very enjoyable to play coop with a friend. It works seamlessly and the progression makes sense for both players. Don't think I would've made it through this game without coop.


### The Bad üëé
- The insane amount of confusion you get playing this game. Some zones were better than others, but its so hard to know where to go and what you have to do. We were so lost on that futuristic open world planet at some point that we had to fully abandon that save file and start fresh.
- The game does a really poor job at explaining its mechanics and systems. We had to accidentally find them on our own or google them.
- The story is just that meme of scifi/fantsy novels where they say a thousand names you never heard like "Tra'zul was rescued from the evil emperor Yaxal from the Neh'rud planet by escaping with the Jurwa'za contraption." I really have no idea what happened for most of the story. 
- The animation cancelling is brutal. Everything you try to do (Heals, getting up, rez, reload etc) requires a 3 second animation that can get cancelled by attacks. Makes it feel so unresponsive and frustrating.
- The lack of items in this game. We found at least 50+ rings, but like 3 sets of armor none of which were better than my starting armor. Same for weapons, there are very few in this game beyond the starting ones. Feels like there's a big lack of content in this game.
- The stats given by the items were such low percentages and so specific. Like "+5% mod regeneration for 5 seconds after you take lightning damage while reloading". Felt lackluster everytime we found a new shiny item.
- The final boss of the game is a master class in bad design. It should be studied for generations and generations. First off, the background is red, the boss is red, the foreground is red, the attacks are red and the ammo pickups are red. Second, it teleports you in and out of 2 arenas, but keeps the old camera angle so it feels very jarring and unpleasant when it happens. Also, the bosses attacks and animations were a little janky and not well telegraphed. Overall just a super frustrating experience that didn't feel rewarding at all.
