**Status**: DONE ✅ (The campaign) <br>
**Hours played**: 37<br>

### The Good 👍
- Very good ARPG gameplay. Has that satisfying oomph when killing waves of enemies.
- Tons of builds to try that are all very different.
- Good enemy and boss variety.
- The depth of each build and itemization is fun to get into and optimize once you start understanding how the game works.
- Maps seem like a fun way to grind the game.

### The Bad 👎
- Very hard to get into as a beginner. I wish there was more in-game help to progressively teach you different aspects of the game. While the depth is fun to get into its also very overwhelming.
- A bit repetitive, but I guess that's every ARPG.
- I wish it was easier to respec a character to try out different builds.
