### The Good 👍
- Really amazing setting and atmosphere. Love the gothic fantasy world.
- Very interesting and unique cast of characters and villains.
- Strikes a great balance between horror and action having less spooky moments than 7.
- I really love how they do horror in this game. Its just always eerie and there's a creepy vibe but there's never cheap jumpscares.
- Art and graphics are absolutely stunning. Love the art direction of the game. Both the characters and environments look so sick.
- Very good story and ending.
- Lady Dimitrescu 👀

### The Bad 👎
- Just like in 7, I really wish there was a better way to avoid attacks in some boss fights rather than just slowly strafing.
