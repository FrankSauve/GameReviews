### The Good üëç
- Such a fun game from start to finish. The controls are so buttery smooth and the game just feels so damn good to play.
- The speedrun mechanics were amazing. Each card doing something different in a super interesting way and it makes you rethink of possible ways to get through a level every time you discover a new card.
- The level design is fantastic. Each level felt VERY unique and fun to complete. I love that most levels had some fun shortcuts to discover and almost none of those shortcuts felt cheap or like I was cheating the level, they always felt good to execute.
- Now for the real meat of the game for me, getting every red medal on every level! I really suggest doing that if you want to play this game. It makes you understand every little corner of the levels and really appreciate them. In video games, I personally really love trying a level/boss over and over when the difficulty feels fairs and I can feel like I'm making progress with every attempt. Neon White totally nailed that feeling for me.
- Competing with friends on the scoreboard is really fun.
- Before playing, I heard that the story was the weak point of this game and that it's "cringe", but honestly I enjoyed it a lot. You just have to not take it too seriously. The characters are all fun to get to know and the main plot is good.
- The sidequests were fun and varied.
- Doing the rushes at the end is a really fun way to do a victory lap of the game.
