**Status**: DONE ‚úÖ<br>
**Hours played**: 15<br>

### The Good üëç
- Very good story and cast of characters. It was pretty much at the same quality level as the movies.
- Voice acting is very good. It really made the characters shine.
- Cutscenes were really cool and pretty. Facial animation was very well made and made the cutscenes very enjoyable to watch.
- Level art is really beautiful. Every level was very unique in style and was a treat for the eyes.
- Combat is good for this type of game. It felt very smooth and the companion ability system was well made.
- Progression is fun and simple. I'm happy they didn't add a ton of stats and items I don't care about. Like +5% damage to X enemy kinda stuff. It just had simple abilities to unlock and that was great.
- Music is great. Especially with the huddle mechanic and the song kicks in and you feel like a badass.

### The Bad üëé
- Sometimes it barely felt like I was playing a game. It's just lots of cutscenes and walking + talking. Not necessarily a bad thing I guess, but worth mentionning.
- The exploration mechanics (like asking companions to smash doors etc.) were fun at first, but got repetitive towards the end. Going through a level got a bit annoying because of that.
- The input delay on the run start and turnaround animations. It's annoying but very manageable for this type of cinematic game.


# SCORE: 8.5/10
