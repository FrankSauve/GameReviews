### The Good 👍
- The gameplay is fun and fast-paced. I like the mix of melee and range weapons.
- The loop and permanent unlockables are nice.
- Pixelated art style is pretty.
- Procedural generation is cool and makes each run pretty varied.
- Decent mix of enemies.

### The Bad 👎
- Just couldn't get into this one. I'm not the biggest roguelite fan, but this just felt repetitive and each run was long before getting to real action.
- The game is hard and gets really punishing at some point, 1 or 2 hits and you're dead.
- The visual clarity could be better. Sometimes I just couldn't see an enemy projectile and it would 1 shot me 15 minutes into a run. It just got pretty frustrating at some point.
- I know I just need to git gud, but there's not much substance and content there to motivate me to git gud. Maybe I'm just getting old :shrug:
- It's just a more bland Hades tbh and I wasn't a Hades stan that much.
