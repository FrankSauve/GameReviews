### The Good üëç
- Amazing journey and story with some incredible epic moments. The feeling of having gone through all of that with the characters was very special. I can't put into words how amazing and special the story felt to me. Probably my top 3 video stories to me.
- Sephiroth is the coolest villain of all time. Every time he would pop up on screen out of nowhere I would get mega hyped.
- Great cast of characters that you end up really feeling attached to.
- THE MUSIC! Wouldn't be a FF game without jaw dropping music that really takes the experience to a whole other level.
- Beautiful graphics, environments and set pieces. Cutscenes were visually stunning.
- Combat had some great moments especially in boss fights. The mix of action combat with turned based actions was very nice.
- Great enemy variety.
- Gear system is nice and simple but still allows for creative fun builds.
- Some fun sidequests and there weren't too many.
- The ending was a great climax and makes you very excited for the sequel.

### The Bad üëé
- Some story moments were a little slow (looking at you Aerith).
- Fighting groups of enemies would feel like a chore sometimes especially if they had high HP for no reason.
- Some animation locking when crawling through a corridor were very slow and kinda annoying, but I'm nittpicking here.
- Sound mixing was bad sometimes. Random civilian NPC would talk too loud or a jukebox would be playing music way too loud and I couldn't hear the story dialogue.

# SCORE: 9.5/10
