![](DiabloIV.jpg){: style="height:250px;width:190px"}

**Status**: DONE ‚úÖ<br>
**Hours played**: 40-50?<br>

### The Good üëç
- Very satisfying combat and grind. VFX and SFX have a nice crunch to them.
- Amazing brain off and kill waves of enemies game.
- Solid campaign with good story.
- Good gear system
- Ability tree is simple and intuitive but still has a good amount of dept.
- Classes are fun and varied. Gameplay itself is topnotch.

### The Bad üëé
- Level scaling sucks. It makes you feel weaker as you level up.
- Horse pathfinding is DOGSHIT. You get stuck on everything and you can't click beyond a wall and have your character go around it. Your character will just get stuck on the wall...
- Not being able to redo the campaign on harder difficulty is kind of a bummer for me. I enjoyed doing that in D3.
- Becomes very grindy and repetitve once the campaign is done. Basically just repeasting dungeons and it all just feels like a chore.
- I dont feel very motivated to play beyond the campaign. Honestly the motivation of these games for me was beating the campaign on all difficulties. I dont really care to beat whatever random dungeon :/

# SCORE: 6.5/10
