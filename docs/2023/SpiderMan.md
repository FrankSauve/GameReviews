**Status**: 100% 💯<br>
**Hours played**: 42<br>

### The Good 👍
- Swinging around is the main positive point of this game. It's so fluid, fun and really never gets old even after 40 hours.
- The story is a classic fun spiderman story and it has some cool cinematic moments.
- Combat is fun and punchy. It has a good variety of moves and gadgets to throw at enemies.
- Graphics and level design are great. It's really fun to play through a pretty realistic looking NYC.
- Side quest are fun and incourage you to want to 100% the map.

### The Bad 👎
- Combat can get kinda old and reptitive after a while especially once you're done unlocking everything. I think its because it never really felt like a challenge and sometimes they just throw wave after wave of the same type of enemies at you and it just gets tiring.
- While 100%'ing was fun, it feels a bit like too much of a chore sometimes especially when they keep adding similar side stuff like crimes in the DLC. It should've been like 3 crimes per district instead of 5.

Overall, I'd say if you just wanna play the main story with a bit of side stuff to unlock more things its a fantastic game with perfect length. But I really wanted to push for the full completion and some aspects of the game got old after some time and that's my main gripes with the game.
