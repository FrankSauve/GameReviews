**Status**: DONE-ish ✅<br>
**Hours played**: 24<br>

### The Good 👍
- Very polished for a game in this genre. Everything felt like it was on a AAA level.
- Combat is great and challenging with lots of variety.
- Game loop is fun and doesn't get too grindy.
- The hiding from the sun and the blood mechanics were both super unique and made the game really interesting.
- Base building was good
- Playing with friends was fun.

### The Bad 👎
- It has the usual thing from survival games where if you don't keep up with the rest of the group you feel like you're way behind and feel overwhelmed with catching up. Not really the game's fault, but it made me less interested towards the end.
