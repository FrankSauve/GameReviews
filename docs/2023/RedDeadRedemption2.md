### The Good üëç
- Most immersive game I've ever played. The world is stunning, the attention to detail on all the art and all the interactions with the NPCs make it all feel so real.
- Great story that has its slow moments but the peaks are really awesome and it takes you to unexpected places. The conclusion to the story was great too.
- Great cast of characters that you get to know so personally.
- The whole thing is such a technical and artistic masterpiece. Its so impressive all the perfect animations and interations there are in the world. The weather systema and all the different biomes and cities we get to see in such detail is really impressive.
- Sound design and music are on point.
- The missions are fun and varied and always add to the story in an interesting way.
- The random encounters you see on the road are all very unique and add so much to the living world.
- Gameplay is fun and works well for this game. I liked using the dead-eye ability a lot.


### The Bad üëé
- Get ready for A LOT of horse riding. While it is fun and immersive at times, it gets very tiring too. You can unlock fast travel eventually, but it is still very slow and tedious.
- What I call "Forced immersion". They force you to slowly walk in certain zones, you have to horse everywhere, pick up one item at a time with its very slow realistic animation. I do enjoy the immersion, but I prefer to control when I want it instead of it being forced on me.
- While the gunplay is fun, its nothing to write home about and gets kinda repetitive.
- I found it kinda weird that we get to upgrade the camp, but we lose acess to the upgrades for like half the game.
