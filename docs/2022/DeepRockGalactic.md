### The Good 👍
- Super fun with friends. Probably one the best coop games out there.
- Good variety in a lot of different aspects (Enemies, missions, characters, weapons, maps etc)
- Fun character customization
- Solid gameplay loop

### The Bad 👎
- Too long to progress through the game and unlock new things. Requires a little too much grinding to my liking.
- Very RNG dependent, which can still be fun, but at the end of the day you can only win with good RNG.
- Got a little boring after a while. Wasn't very motivated to push pass the second level.
