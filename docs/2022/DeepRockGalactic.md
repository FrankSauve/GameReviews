### The Good 👍
- Super fun with friends. Probably one the best coop games out there.
- Good variety in a lot of different aspects (Enemies, missions, characters, weapons, maps etc)
- Fun character customization
- Solid gameplay loop

### The Bad 👎
 - No steam and game pass crossplay :frank_crainge:
 - Gunplay could be a bit better, but its still fun.
