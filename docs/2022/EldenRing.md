### The Good üëç
+ Fromsoft somehow took an already perfect series to a whole other level of perfection
+ Best gameplay loop ever.
+ Very challenging, but still fair with all the tools available to the player to beat bosses.
+ Most beautiful looking zones and dungeons I've ever seen.
+ Amazing and varied bosses.
+ Good simple story.
+ So many cool build possibilities and so much replayability.
+ All the new QoL things were amazing such as stakes of marika, teleporting with the map, compass, leveling up at any site of grace etc.
+ Made me want to 100% the game.
+ Really makes you want to explore every single corner in the game.
+ Perfect length
+ Will definitely come back for an NG+ run with a new build.
