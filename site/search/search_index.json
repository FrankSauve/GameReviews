Cute little story with interesting characters. Cutscenes were always funny and original. Gameplay loop is very fun. Catching fish, make some sushi, make some money and upgrade your stuff. Really good variety of things to catch and just things to do in general. There's a crazy amount of different small little mechanics and \"mini-games\". Every boss encounter had something different to it. Art is really pretty and music is vibey. The Bad \ud83d\udc4e Not a fan of mashing the A button to catch a fish. It just kills the chill vibe of hunting for fish imo. There's even a setting to automate that, but its way less efficient than mashing so I don't really understand why its there.

Combat and platforming both feel so snappy and responsive. Very fun platforming. It was probably my favorite part of the game. I love that it really makes use of your newly learned abilities all the time. Boss fights were all very unique and fun. Great combat mechanics. I liked the parry a lot. Cool art style and vfx. A good kind of challenging while remaining fair. I liked that there was a guided mode because I don't like having to remember the locked doors in a metroidvania. I'd rather they show me where it was once I've unlocked the new ability. The Bad \ud83d\udc4e Story was just ok. Wasn't really invested into it since most its exposure is at the beginning then \"big\" climax at the end. I wasn't really attached to the characters. Regular enemies kinda felt insignificant. I kinda just ignored them most of the time because they didn't give that many souls for the effort it took to kill them. Too many back to back bosses at the end. It was getting tedious.
